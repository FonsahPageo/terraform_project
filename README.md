This ia a peoject to set up a virtual private cloud environment within AWS public cloud.
The aim is to have multiple VPCs with two subnets each.
One vpc is public and has a route to the internet through an internet gateway while the others are private.
Traffic can flow from the ublic VPC to the others but not the other way round
